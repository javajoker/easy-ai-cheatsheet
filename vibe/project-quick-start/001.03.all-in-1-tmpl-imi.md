I'm going to create a project for open IP authorization for secondary creations, and eBay mall platform based on secondary creation products. I'll attach the PRD, ui/ux design spec, and tech design spec for this project. please help me to create code project following the given docs.

please create a frontend app, the app will use mockData to demonstrate full interactions following UI/UX spec. the mockData shall follow the structure of backend DB design accordingly.

1. do NOT consider any fancy appearance for the outlook, use as simple styles as possible, just to demonstrate the interactions and workflow.
2. do NOT miss any views or components specified in the UI/UX design document.
3. do NOT miss any function features specified in the PRD.

thanks.
