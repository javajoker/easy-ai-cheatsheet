[TODO: list api docs, and code structure, fulfill missing part]

So far you've created:

1. package.json with dependencies
2. Main server.ts file
3. All entity files (User, IPAsset, License entities, Product/Transaction/AuthorizationChain, Admin entities)
4. I18n configuration files (English and Traditional Chinese)

Assume you've already created the following features

1. Services (auth, email, ip-asset, license, product, payment, admin, file-upload, blockchain, notification, queue)
2. Controllers (auth, ip-asset, license, product, payment, admin, notification)
3. Routes (auth, ip-asset, license, product, payment, admin)

You need to create:

1. Additional supporting services (cache, audit)
2. User routes and controller
3. Verification routes and controller
4. Analytics routes and controller
...

Please continue with the backend project creation. 

Please continue with the remaining services first, no need to create the code that assume you've created.
