Create an open IP authorization secondary creation and eBay mall platform based on secondary creation products.

I'll provide prototype source for this project, please help to do the following

1. create Product requirements document (PRD) based on the project description, and prototype source.
2. create design document of UI/UX spec for the product based on the PRD, including any missing pages or views that the prototype has not included, for example, item detail views
3. create tech design document based on the PRD, and UI/UX design document, e.g., backend api document

All output shall be well organized, which will guide the tech development work later.
