Create an open IP authorization secondary creation and eBay mall platform based on secondary creation products.

1. Anyone can register IP/IP content to the platform, set open IP authorization content (such as the qualification requirements of the authorized person, etc.), and the authorization setting includes the share ratio
2. The authorization is sold as a commodity. The sales method is a share commission.
3. Anyone who meets the authorization qualifications can realize secondary creation based on the authorized IP and register this secondary creation on this platform. All secondary creation products can be sold on this platform. This product is automatically certified as an IP authorized genuine product and can be verified on the platform. All secondary creation sales will follow the preset authorization share strategy.
4. Furthermore, the platform also supports re-creation based on secondary creation IP. And so on.
5. If the secondary creation product violates the authorization agreement, the licensor can revoke the authorized license, corresponding to all commodity will lose its genuine license. (however, authorized history can be verified)

Please design a web app product for this, including creators/secondary creators, and IP secondary creation consumer product buyers.
